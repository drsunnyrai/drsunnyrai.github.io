Hi! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisors are [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and [Dr. Sharath C. Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/). I completed Ph.D. from the University of Delhi, India. I specialize in culturally aware Natural Language Processing with a focus on AI in Health. Currently, I am working on:

- Identifying cross-cultural variations in depression and benchmarking its impact on AI mental health screening
- Building a culturally informed chatbot for HPV vaccine counseling for families
- Characterizing how and why social emotions (shame, pride & guilt) are expressed across cultures
- Measuring harmful gender norms in entertainment media - a colab with the World Bank
