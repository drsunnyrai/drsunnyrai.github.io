I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer and Information Science, working with [Dr. Sharath C. Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/) and [Dr. Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the University of Delhi, India. I study sociolinguistic variations in human language to enable fair and inclusive NLP applications. Below are a few research problems I am currently working on:

*  How and why shame is expressed across cultures
*  Harmful social norms - a colab with the World Bank
*  Cross-cultural considerations for AI mental health systems
