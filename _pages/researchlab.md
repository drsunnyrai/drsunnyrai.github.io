I study language, culture and cognitive constructs to enable inclusive and accessible health applications. My ongoing research projects focuses on these two questions:

* AI for Well being: Can we predict health behaviors from one's language? Do linguistic expressions indicating health behaviors vary across demographics? - I study these questions to learn what influences health behaviors, how can we persuade people for healthy behaviors and how language models can help this goal. 

* Socio-cultural Alignment of Language Models: Language models lack the understanding of cultural variations. How do we assess cultural hetereogeniety of language models? And, how can we teach socio-cultural norms to language models to enable culturally aligned interactions?
